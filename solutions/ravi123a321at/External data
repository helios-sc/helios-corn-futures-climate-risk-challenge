External data was used conservatively to confirm whether climate stress translated into real plant stress, without introducing market information or rebuilding a parallel climate model.

Soil Moisture (Physiological Confirmation)

What: Soil moisture anomalies (surface + root zone), combined with greater weight on root-zone moisture.
Why: Root-zone moisture directly reflects the water available to corn roots and is a strong indicator of actual plant stress.
How it was used:
Converted to anomalies (z-scores) relative to local history
Aggregated at the country level
Used conservatively as a validation layer alongside Helios climate risk signals
What it is NOT:
Not a replacement climate model
Not a yield estimate
Not market-derived
Key constraint respected: Climate-only, public, non-market data.

External Weather (Used Selectively)

What: Limited atmospheric variables such as:
Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)
Evapotranspiration (ET₀)
Water Deficit (Precipitation − ET₀)
Why: These variables capture atmospheric demand and rapid drying dynamics that precipitation alone cannot.
How it was used:
As anomalies or trends
Aggregated conservatively at the country level
Used only in the exploratory submission, not the primary conservative submission
What it is NOT:
Not tuned to futures behavior
Not used to rebuild Helios’s climate risk model
Key constraint respected: External weather variables were treated as secondary context, not primary drivers.

To ensure compliance with competition rules and avoid CFCS inflation, the following guardrails were enforced:

❌ No futures_* columns or derivatives were used
❌ No lagged or transformed market prices
❌ No features designed to mirror or proxy futures behavior
✅ All external data is climate-derived and publicly available
✅ All rolling, cumulative, and seasonal calculations are strictly backward-looking
✅ External features were used conservatively and sparingly
