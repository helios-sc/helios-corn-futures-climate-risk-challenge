# Helios Corn Futures Climate Challenge — Reproducibility Package

## Overview
This repository contains the complete, reproducible feature engineering pipeline
used to generate my submissions for the Helios Corn Futures Climate Challenge.

The approach translates climate stress into expected corn supply risk using
biologically grounded and economically interpretable signals. All features are
derived exclusively from climate risk data and approved external climate-only
sources.
