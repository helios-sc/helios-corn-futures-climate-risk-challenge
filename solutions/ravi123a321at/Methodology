Methodology Summary — Helios Corn Futures Climate Challenge

Objective

The objective of this work is to identify biologically and economically meaningful climate signals that translate weather stress into expected corn supply risk, while prioritizing robustness, interpretability, and 
strict compliance with the competition’s anti-leakage and anti-gaming rules.
The approach focuses on modeling real agricultural mechanisms rather than mechanically maximizing correlation metrics.

Data Sources
Competition Data
Helios Climate Risk Dataset
Drought stress
Heat stress
Cold stress
Excess precipitation
Regional Production Share Data
Used to weight climate exposure by economic importance

External Data (Approved, Limited Scope)
Soil Moisture Anomalies (Surface + Root Zone)
Public, climate-derived source
Root-zone moisture emphasized to reflect actual corn root water availability
Used solely as physiological confirmation of plant water stress
Contains no market, price, yield, or futures information

External Atmospheric Indicators (Primary Submission Only)
Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)
Reference Evapotranspiration (ET₀)
Water Delicit (Precipitation − ET₀)
Used only as anomalies or short-term trends to detect rapid drying dynamics
Not used to reconstruct climate risk or proxy futures behavior
No other external or proprietary data sources were used.

Feature Engineering Philosophy
All features were designed to reflect real agricultural and physical mechanisms, not to optimize CFCS mechanically.
Each feature adheres to the following principles:

Causal Directionality
Climate conditions → Crop stress → Yield risk → Futures price response

Temporal Integrity
All features use information available at or before date_on.
No future data is used directly or indirectly.

Generality
Signals represent biologically stable relationships expected to persist across years, regions, and market regimes.

Core Feature Categories
1. Baseline Severity Aggregation

Country-level, production-weighted aggregation of climate risk severity using:
Mean (average exposure)
Max (extreme tail risk)
Dispersion measures (variability and concentration)
This captures both overall exposure and localized extremes without artificial amplification.
Spatial Concentration:
Spatial concentration metrics (Herfindahl–Hirschman Index) are computed to distinguish localized climate shocks from geographically widespread stress, reflecting differences between regional disruptions and systemic supply risk.

2. Persistence and Stress Memory

Rolling, momentum, and cumulative measures capture sustained climate stress, reflecting the biological reality that corn plants accumulate damage over time rather than responding to isolated daily shocks.

3. Phenology Weighting

Climate stress is weighted by crop growth stage to reflect known yield sensitivity during critical development periods such as silking and grain fill.
Northern and Southern Hemisphere growing calendars are handled separately to preserve biological meaning and avoid seasonal misalignment.

4. Limited Climate Interactions

A small number of climate-only interaction features (e.g., heat × drought) are included to capture known non-linear physiological stress responses. These interactions are biologically motivated and restricted strictly to climate variables.

5. External Physiological Confirmation

Soil moisture anomalies are used to confirm whether observed climatic conditions translate into actual plant water stress, reducing false positives where weather signals do not result in physiological impact.
In the primary submission, limited atmospheric indicators (VPD, ET₀, and water deficit) are additionally used to detect rapid drying dynamics. External data serves a confirmatory role only and does not replace Helios climate risk signals.
What Was Explicitly Avoided
To maintain scientific integrity and avoid metric gaming, the following were intentionally excluded:
Futures prices, returns, volatility, or any market-derived variables
Lagged or transformed futures data
Circular or self-referential feature construction
Threshold-based amplification designed solely to inflate CFCS

Submission Strategy

Two submissions were produced:

Primary Submission

Includes baseline aggregation, persistence, phenology, spatial concentration, soil moisture, and limited external atmospheric confirmation
Emphasizes biological realism and economic relevance
Designed to generalize across historical and future regimes

Secondary Submission 

Includes baseline aggregation, persistence, phenology, and soil moisture only
Excludes external atmospheric indicators and interaction features
Provided as a conservative robustness reference

Compliance Confirmation
I confirm that no futures_* columns or derivatives were used to generate any climate_risk_* features, in full accordance with the competition’s anti-gaming rules.
All engineered features are derived exclusively from climate, weather, and soil moisture data.
