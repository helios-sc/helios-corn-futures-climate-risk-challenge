Feature Engineering Pipeline (Executive Summary)
The pipeline converts daily climate risk data into biologically meaningful supply-risk signals through a strictly causal, climate-only process. Country-level production-weighted aggregates capture severity and 
spatial exposure of drought, heat, cold, and excess precipitation. Persistence and cumulative stress features model biological damage accumulation over time. Phenology weighting aligns climate stress with 
crop growth stages, with separate calendars for Northern and Southern Hemisphere producers. Public, climate-derived soil moisture anomalies are used as physiological confirmation of plant stress. All features are
aggregated to monthly granularity and exported as climate_risk_* variables only. No futures prices, returns, volatility, or market-derived data are used at any stage

Stage 1: Baseline Climate Aggregation
Country-level production-weighted aggregation of Helios climate risk variables (drought, heat, cold, excess precipitation).

Stage 2: Persistence and Stress Memory
Rolling and cumulative climate stress features capturing sustained exposure.

Stage 3: Phenology Weighting
Climate stress weighted by crop growth stage using hemisphere-specific calendars.

Stage 4: External Physiological Confirmation
Public soil moisture anomalies are merged at the country-date level to confirm whether climate stress results in actual plant water stress.

Stage 5: Monthly Aggregation and Export
All features are aggregated to monthly granularity and exported as climate_risk_* columns.
