My approach starts from recognizing that raw region-level climate counts are often too noisy and fragmented to relate cleanly to market outcomes, so I first compressed them into an interpretable country‑day signal by aggregating regional risks in proportion to economic importance and letting the regions that matter most to national production drive the signal. 

I then kept the feature set intentionally small but expressive: a few intuitive stress measures (severity, extreme‑event share, “warning‑or‑worse” share) plus simple interactions that reflect plausible mechanisms (e.g., heat×dry compounding, wet–dry imbalance, max/mean stress across risk types). Because the scoring is correlation-based, I framed feature design as a search over simple time‑series shapes—rolling averages and maxima, volatility, exponential smoothing, and threshold/streak/run‑length style constructs. 

A key insight is that these relationships are often regime‑dependent (seasonal and country‑specific), so I evaluated signals within country-by-month seasonal buckets to isolate when and where a mechanism is active instead of averaging it across unrelated periods. 

Finally, the workflow is deliberately pragmatic: run a fast, broad scan to identify the handful of regimes where signal concentrates, then refine more deeply, prioritizing patterns that remain stable across recent-year subsets.

To ensure replicable results, below was the exact command I ran. It was only afterwards to prevent data leakage that I made sure to personally only select for configurations with shift >=0 to submit, as per my submission notebook.
