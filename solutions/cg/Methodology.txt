Methodology
1. Data Sources Used
Only the host provided dataset is used.
There is Worldwide Crop Production added to the notebook but it has not been used.

2. Key Steps
The first half of the code is to ensure same no of rows in submission.
The main features are obtained by combining each type of risk of a single date into a single value.
The average percent production of each country in recent years has been added as a dictionary to do this in the code.
The rationale is that the overall global production has an impact on futures market rather than 
a single country production.
Only the top 30 features that correlate the maximum with all targets are kept in final submission.

There is no usage of any futures column to generate a feature.
